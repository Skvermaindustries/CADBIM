## * Procedure              

**1. Open LibreCAD:** Launch the LibreCAD software on your computer.

**2. Create a New Drawing:** Start a new drawing by selecting "File" > "New" from the menu bar. 

**3. Set Drawing Units:** Set the drawing units to the desired measurement units by selecting "Options" > "Current Drawing Preferences" from the menu bar. In the dialog that appears, go to the "Units" tab, and set the units accordingly (e.g., meters, millimetres, inches, etc.).

**4. Draw the Flower:** Use the drawing tools to create the circle.
 
**5.** Draw the radius of circle as your wish.

**6.** Copy the circle of radius and move to the left side of the circle.

**7.** Modify/Rotate the circle to the intersection point of the first circle.

**8.** Dialog box will popup choose 5 multiple of that circle.

**9.** Create a new layer to hatch the flower, select all the flower and click on hatch button according to the choice of your colour.

**10.** Once the drawing is complete, save the file by selecting "File" > "Save As" from the menu bar and choosing a file format and location to save the drawing.

**11.** Export or Print the Drawing: If necessary, you can export the drawing to a DXF or print it directly from LibreCAD.

- Follow the first 3 steps for other drawing like Footing, H1 Wash room ,  hostel Room plan 

- After doing this just bfollow the measurements and use the simole tools like line, fillet, cut, offset, hatch , colour, layer . 

- At the end once the Drawing is completed save it by cliking ctrl+s 
- For next step Follow the Step 11. 

### #For 3D model of Hut 

**1.Open FreeCAD:** Launch the LibreCAD software on your computer.
 
**2.Download the BIM Workbench:**
Visit the FreeCAD BIM Workbench repository on GitHub.

**3.Download the Latest Release:**
Download the latest release of the BIM Workbench in a format compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**4.Install BIM Workbench:**
- Follow the installation instructions provided in the README file or on the GitHub page.

- For most operating systems, it typically involves extracting the downloaded files and copying them to the appropriate directory where FreeCAD is installed.

**5.Restart the FreeCAD:**
- Close any open instances of FreeCAD.

- Restart FreeCAD to ensure that the BIM Workbench is installed and available.

**6.Enable BIM Workbench:**

- After restarting FreeCAD, open the application.

- Switch to the BIM Workbench by selecting it from the workbench dropdown menu.

**7.Start BIM Workbench:**

- After restarting FreeCAD, open the application.

- Switch to the BIM Workbench by selecting it from the workbench dropdown menu.

**8.Start Using BIM Workbench:**

- Switch to the BIM Workbench from the workbench selector drop-down menu.

**9.Create a Building:**

- Select the rectangular box according to your design requirement and click on wall icon.

- Give the dimensions to the wall like thickness (300mm) and height (3000mm).

**10.Add Structures:**

- Add structure elements like slabs, and roofs using the BIM tools.

**11.Add Windows and Doors:**

- Insert window (1000mm x 1000mm) and door (900mm x 2100mm) objects into the openings created earlier.

**12.Add Floor:**

- Insert floor of L= 5000mm, B=4000mm, H=200mm.

**13.Add HEB 180 girders:**

- Insert HEB 180 girders of height(200mm) and length(4000mm) on the upper walls and spaced according to the requirements.

**14.Add Slab:**

- Insert slab of L= 5000mm, B=4000mm, H=200mm.

**15.Export to IFC:**

- Export the BIM model to the IFC format for interoperability with other BIM software.

**16.Save Your Drawing:**

- Once you are satisfied with your basement slab plan, save your drawing file to your computer.

**17.Export or Print:**

- Depending on your requirements, you can export your drawing to various file formats or print it directly from LibreCAD for documentation or sharing purposes.

### ## For 3D house on Blender

-  Open the  Blender softwera
- tak the dimension as you want to make the house
- adjust the shape and size of the cube according to our house plan in rough 
- after that select the box and then change the mode to Edit Mode from object mode.
- then use the loop cut tool to mrk the windows, doors, ventilation cut etc.
- use bevel tool to shape the roof 
- now aad new cube to creat the floor. 
-  now click on Add - meshes- archimesh and select the doors and windows to aad it in the model . adjust the size and position accordintg tho the model. 
- After this start the material and texturing of the model by going to the material section and adjust the colour and texture pattern accordingly. 
- at the end save the file on desktop for easy aaccess.

## Discussion:

- by using Libera cad we get a an over view of using software for designing of Civil structures
- It hase almost similar to AutoCAD so for switching from LibreCAD to AutoCAD will not make much difference.
- Freecad provide the Overview of 3D modeling and the visulisation of one self .
- FreeCAD help to know the all aspects of the designed plan before executing it on ground which helps us to minimize the errors  in projects.
-  Blender is another 3D modeling applicatin it has very vast use in almost very industry wether for construction, gaming, mechanical etc.
- Blender is actually quite difficult in beginning but once we get to know the our use tools and how to use it then it become to easy to use like a pro .

## Conclusion
- By using all the above software we came to know that there are plenty of opportunities and application available for free which are used in our domain industry . 
- it gives the confidence to came up with new idea and skill which is required for the current industry for the job and freelancing. 
- it gprovide the good knowledge of software related to construction and design industry.
